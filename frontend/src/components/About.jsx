        <p>
          WxDecoder was built to solve a friction point in aviation: raw data is reliable, but parsing it is tedious and feels archaic.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining live FAA weather and NOTAM data with OpenAI's natural language processing, this tool acts as a 
          <span className="text-white font-semibold"> second set of eyes</span> during your preflight planning. 
          It doesn't replace the briefing—it translates it into actionable intelligence.

          As a private pilot myself, my goal was to design a tool that could:

          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-100">Decode Raw Data:</strong> Take METARs, TAFs and NOTAMs and decode into a briefing overview.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-100">Trust but Verify:</strong> Display raw FAA data side-by-side with the AI summary for verification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-gray-100">Enhance Situational Awareness:</strong> Provide a quick-glance view for local flight planning and crosswind limitations.
